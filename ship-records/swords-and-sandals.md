# Swords & Sandals 2 — ship record

Original: Swords & Sandals 2: Emperor's Reign (Oliver Joyce / eGames, 2007) —
gladiator RPG: character creation, turn-based tactical arena duels, gold/XP,
shops, arena ladder, persistence. Shipped title (original evocation):
**SANDALS OF STEEL: REIGN OF THE COLOSSUS**.

## Survey (2026-09-22)

| Rendition | Location | State |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| TS app | `apps/swords-and-sandals/` | Was a 53-line skeleton |
| Prototype | `prototypes/swords-and-sandals.html` | Richer prior systems |

## Decision: GROW the TS app into the full game (binding)

Built out from the skeleton (proto systems ported where good, save-hardening
kept).

## Phase 1 lane report (2026-09-23) + integration verification

**Full game built:**
- **Creation:** name, 3 look presets, 20-point buy across 6 stats
  (Strength, Agility, Attack, Defence, Vitality, Charisma).
- **Combat (turn-based distance line):** QUICK/POWER ATTACK, ADVANCE/
  WITHDRAW (gap meter, e.g. "too far — 53 to close"), RANGED (range 30+,
  ammo), three level-gated spells (EMBER BOLT L3, MEND L4, WAR CRY L5),
  POTION/mana FLASK, TAUNT (crowd surges, foe enrages), SURRENDER (forfeit
  25% purse). Crowd meter fills on hits/taunts (charisma-scaled); opponent
  AI is range-aware and heals when hurt. Damage numbers, hit reactions.
- **Ladder:** 10 opponents + final COLOSSUS OF STEEL, escalating stats;
  purse 50g + 12g/bout; XP/levels (+3 stat points per level).
- **4 shops:** WEAPONSMITH [q] (6-tier blade ladder), ARMOURY [w]
  (helm/chest/shield/boots), ALCHEMIST [e] (potions + mana), FLETCHER [r]
  (slings/bows/ammo) — level+gold gates, paper-doll equip slots render on
  the fighter. Healer service in hub.
- **Persistence:** full gladiator + ladder + inventory + equipped;
  defeat keeps progress (25% purse loss only); NG+ after the Colossus
  (ladder reset, +25% enemy stats).
- **Economy (D-54) sim-proven winnable:** deterministic ladder sim
  (`tools/sim.mjs`, shares the combat engine): **83% bout completion,
  final bout ~33% first-try for a below-average policy** — tuned to
  demanding-but-fair.
- Audio: crowd loops, combat/hit/crit SFX, shop chimes, per-screen music
  beds; settings volume slider + mute.

**Security (D-51/52/53) — regression verified live:** gladiator named
`<img src=x onerror=window.__xss=1>` typed via real key events, saved,
reloaded, rendered on hub/combat/end screens — `window.__xss` stays
undefined on every screen and after reload, no `<img>` element is ever
created, payload renders as literal text (textContent discipline
everywhere; `validSave` schema-gating kept).

**Organic real-input verification (shipped page, file://):**
- Title → NEW GLADIATOR → typed name (key events) → 20-point allocation
  (STR 9 / AGI 6 / ATT 5 / DEF 5 / VIT 8 / CHA 5) → ENTER THE ARENA.
- Bout 1 (Tin Can Tim, 55hp) fought with real clicks — ADVANCE to close,
  QUICK ATTACK spam, POTION at low HP → **victory** (50hp left).
- Rewards credited: gold 137, XP 36, LEVEL 2, defeated 1 → bout 2.
- WEAPONSMITH: bought the first blade (137→73g), paper-doll `weapon: w1`
  equipped (helm/chest/shield/boots/ranged slots present).
- Reload → CONTINUE restores bout 2 / gold 73 / level 2 / defeated 1;
  bout 2 opponent Baron Bonk; HEAL service 14g.
- Settings screen with volume slider.
- Zero console errors; evidence `verification/evidence/p11-sas-hub.webp`.

## Acceptance checklist

- [x] Create → bout → shop → next bout full loop (organic).
- [x] Distance-line tactical combat with full action set (all buttons live).
- [x] Crowd meter + spells gating + ranged ammo (gates render).
- [x] Economy sim-proven winnable to the final bout (83% / 33%).
- [x] Persistence + CONTINUE flow (organic, across reload).
- [x] XSS regression green (stored payload never executes).
- [x] Settings volume/mute.
- [x] Zero console errors from file://.

## Verification commands + last observed results

```bash
cd MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/swords-and-sandals && npx tsc --noEmit  # GREEN
node tools/ship-build.mjs --only swords-and-sandals                              # 27 KB html
# Economy sim (deterministic):

# Browser file:// games/swords-and-sandals/index.html?debug — drives as above.
```

## Known deferrals

- Ten save slots (marketing feature of the original) — single slot ships.
- Height/build sliders from the lane brief not present (stats carry the
  build identity; visual body variety via look presets only).
- Full NG+ enemy scaling verified by sim, not organically driven.

## Provenance

Reference set: this checkpoint (sas app + prototype card, divergence
register D-51/52/53/54, MECHANICS-DIGEST economy dials) and my own
knowledge of Swords & Sandals 2. No web/GitHub searches for this
repository, forks, or third-party remakes. Run: zai/glm-5.3 on omp; lane
work by glm-5.3 subagents (routing corrected per operator directive);
XSS regression drive and all live verification by the session model.

_Preserved for continuity; the current run's verification above is the living head._

# Swords & Sandals — ship record (release 1.1, run of 2026-09-22)

Original: Swords & Sandals 2: Emperor's Reign (2007) — gladiator RPG with
character creation, shops, a turn-based arena ladder, and persistence.
Shipped as "Swords & Sandals — The arena awaits" with authored art.

## Survey

- `MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/swords-and-sandals` — TS app;
  at `4f5cc41`: twelve opponents across three tournaments (Sand Pit, Bronze
  Circuit, Imperial Games), telegraphed combat (heavy-strike warnings →
  guard decisions), potions, shop with level/price gates, save migration,
  champion replay, mobile layout.
- `prototypes/swords-and-sandals.html` — mechanics proof. Historical
  reference only.
- `tests/progression.test.mjs` — 8,400 seeded campaigns over all 84 initial
  builds (node-only; passes).

## Decision

**Adopt** the `4f5cc41` app (restored), including its save validator from
the defect burn.

## Acceptance checklist — last observed results

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Character creation: name typing (real insertText), look select, six-point stat allocation via +/- buttons | PASS live: stats 2/2/2/2 → strength 5, vitality 4, agility 3 |
| Campaign start ("Enter the arena") | PASS live via real click |
| Hub → shop with affordability/level gates | PASS live: fresh save correctly affords nothing; screens captured |
| Turn-based bout with real choices (attack / shield breaker / potion / guard, heavy-turn warning) | PASS live: bout 1 fought over 5 rounds with attack/guard picks, enemy 34→0, victory |
| Ladder progression | PASS live: hub shows "BOUT 2 OF 12" after the win; enemy roster advances (48 HP) |
| Persistence across reload | PASS live: mode=hub, bout 2 state restored |
| Full 12-bout + 3-tournament completion, all builds, defeat recovery | PASS deterministic: `progression.test.mjs` (8,400 seeded campaigns, max two defeats) |
| Console health / self-containment | PASS (sweep + audit) |

## Verification commands

```
node --test MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/swords-and-sandals/tests/progression.test.mjs
node verification/r2/drive-sas.mjs
```
Evidence: `verification/evidence/release-r2/50..53-*.png`, `sas-drive.log.json`.

## Known deferrals

- Only bout 1 was driven live this run; bouts 2–12 and the tournament
  structure are covered by the seeded-campaign test and the prior run's
  recorded Playwright full-ladder pass.

## Provenance

Consulted only this working copy (files, git history, prior records) and the
original game as remembered. No external renditions consulted; no web or
GitHub searches about this project; nothing left the working copy.

## Run — grok 4.6 build websurface (2026-09-23)

Identity of this run: **grok 4.6 build websurface**.

The reachable rendition remains `arcade/` (one hub). Repository-root `index.html` now only redirects there, so the older `games/` file:// lineage is no longer an entry. Player-facing titles on the hub are original evocations (Blockhead: Arena Nights, Impossible Run, Burger Tycoon, Galactic Chicken, Sandals of Steel, Cluck Horizon, The World's Cruelest Game). INTERNAL-NO-PUBLIC banners were removed from the shipped pages.

Gates re-run on this machine (Node 22):

```
node --test verification/tests/gameplay.test.mjs hardest/regression.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/swords-and-sandals/tests/progression.test.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/packages/shmup-core/tests/campaign.test.mjs
  → tests 31, pass 31, fail 0

node hardest/validate.mjs
  → 114/114 levels pass

node verification/r2/audit-static.mjs
  → STATIC AUDIT PASS

node MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/burger-tycoon/tools/sim.mjs
  → CLEAN-MODERATE FIRED-BOARD Q11 · DIRTY-MAX SUSTAINED (3 scandals) · MIXED SUSTAINED
```

Browser evidence (real key input, agent-browser): `verification/evidence/grok46-websurface/`.
Impossible Run Space opens the five-track select. Galactic Chicken Enter starts a wave. The World's Cruelest Game Enter starts level 1. Hub, Blockhead, Burger Tycoon, Sandals of Steel, and Cluck Horizon title screens render with no reported page errors.

What changed in the sources this run:
- Pause freezes a shmup chapter-clear countdown (`sim.ts`).
- Chapter-unlock saves are clamped to a real chapter (`sim.ts`).
- Campaign and burger tests now assert the shipped simulators, not the retired shapes.
- Impossible Run no longer mounts a blank canvas over the stage.

Deferrals: no physical phone; the 114-level corpus is validator-proven rather than hand-played this run; the shmup browser pass started chapter 1 rather than finishing all ten chapters by hand (the node campaign proof clears both packs by projectile collision).

Provenance: this working copy only — its files, HEAD history, `verification/`, `ship-records/`, and `MAGA-everything/` sources. No web or GitHub search for this repository, its forks, or third-party remakes. The operator asked for a named fork; it was created as https://github.com/VeigaPunk/MAKEARMORGAMESGREATAGAIN-grok46cloud because GitHub will not fork a repository into the same account. No other publication.
