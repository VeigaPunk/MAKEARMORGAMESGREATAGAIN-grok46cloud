# Fleet ship record — Armor Arcade release 1.1 (run of 2026-09-22, Windows)

This is the umbrella record. Per-title records: `boxhead.md`, `impossible.md`,
`burger-tycoon.md`, `chicken-invaders.md` (includes the Cluck Horizon pack),
`swords-and-sandals.md`, `hardest.md`.

## Survey of prior work (what this run found)

- `4f5cc41` (in this repository's git history, now reverted by `4d100bb`) — a
  complete eight-game ship: six Vite/TS monorepo apps + `hardest/` + a copy of
  the operator's `tcg/prototype` card game ("Clashbound"), a Playwright
  browser gate, a tar package step, ChatGPT Sites hosting config
  (`.openai/hosting.json`), and a GitHub workflow. The revert removed all of
  it from HEAD; the game work remained recoverable in history.
- `verification/` — checkpoint audit rounds (defect register, runtime
  verdicts, evidence) predating that ship; the ship commit's `RELEASE.md`
  recorded that its defect burn repaired the flagged blockers.
- `prototypes/` — zero-dependency single-file mechanics proofs for four
  titles. Kept untouched as historical reference; NOT reachable from the
  entry point (the monorepo apps supersede them).
- `hardest/` — dependency-free game + 114-level corpus + validator.
- Operator tooling (`tcg/`, `.omp/`, `.ufo/`) — untouched, not depended on.

## Decisions this run

1. **Adopt the reverted game work** (`git checkout 4f5cc41 -- …`) — prior
   shipped work outranks re-implementation; the revert was of the
   *publishing* approach (Sites hosting, CI, tar releases), which this run
   does not reproduce. Nothing is pushed, published, or hosted.
2. **Drop Clashbound/tcg from the deliverable** — operator tooling must not
   be depended on. The hub now has seven cards: the six roster titles, with
   the shmup engine's second content pack (Cluck Horizon, original IP) as
   its own card per the checkpoint's architecture note.
3. **Commit the playable artifact** — `arcade/` is the finished, committed
   artifact (5.7 MB). `node tooling/build.mjs` regenerates it in place from
   the TS sources; players never need a build. This removes the prior ship's
   fatal gap (a gitignored `dist/` that required Node + registry access).
4. **Zero-dependency verification** — Playwright is gone. This run's browser
   verification drives the real artifact with trusted CDP input events
   (keys with proper `e.code`, held keys, mouse, touch) through the
   substrate-native `agent-browser` daemon; the driver library
   (`verification/r2/cdp.mjs`, ~250 lines, node ≥22 builtins only) is
   committed and re-runnable. Node-only test suites and validators are
   unchanged and pass.

## Release gate — exact commands and last observed results (2026-09-22)

From the repository root (Node ≥ 22 required; no network, no installs):

```
node --test verification/tests/gameplay.test.mjs hardest/regression.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/swords-and-sandals/tests/progression.test.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/packages/shmup-core/tests/campaign.test.mjs
  → tests 31, pass 31, fail 0

node hardest/validate.mjs
  → 114/114 levels pass

node verification/r2/audit-static.mjs
  → STATIC AUDIT PASS (7 games complete, no external URLs, hub integrity)

node tooling/serve.mjs        # http://127.0.0.1:4173 (artifact server)
```

Browser-input gates (need the agent-browser daemon; see
`verification/r2/README.md` for the protocol):

```
node verification/r2/drive-impossible.mjs   → 3/3 courses cleared, 0 deaths (27.2/34.7/40.5 s), death→instant-respawn, pause, mute
node verification/r2/drive-hardest.mjs      → level 1 cleared, save records gold medal 0 deaths 4.18 s; joystick pointer control proven
node verification/r2/drive-shmup.mjs        → both packs: chapter 1 cleared + named boss down + chapter 2 unlocked; replica reached ch2 wave 3 boss
node verification/r2/drive-boxhead.mjs      → wave 1 cleared → wave 2 (score 3300), natural death, retry, pause/resume, deathmatch boots 2 players
node verification/r2/drive-burger.mjs       → dirty actions toggle, PR spend −$100, pause, mute, reload-resume
node verification/r2/drive-sas.mjs          → creation, stat allocation, shop gate, bout 1 won, campaign persisted across reload
node verification/r2/sweep-runtime.mjs      → 0 console errors on all 7 pages, hub cards + return links, mobile 390×844 layout, touch virtual stick live
```

Typecheck (dev-side; needs the workspace install):
```
npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present   (in MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games)
  → 0 errors across all 8 workspaces
```

## Evidence

`verification/evidence/release-r2/` — screenshots (hub, per-game title and
key states), drive logs (JSON), this run's inputs. Prior rounds' evidence is
preserved untouched in its original folders.

## Fleet-wide deferrals

- The six Vite apps require an HTTP origin (ES modules); only `hardest/`
  runs from `file://` directly. The hub README states this. A trivial local
  static server (`node tooling/serve.mjs` or `python -m http.server`) is the
  documented play path — within the objective's allowance.
- Touch input is verified at the CDP input level (trusted touch events drove
  the Boxhead virtual stick; hardest's joystick accepts any pointer) plus a
  mobile-viewport layout pass. Physical phone/iOS/Safari hardware remains
  unverified, as in the prior release.
- No in-browser full-campaign WIN screenshot for the shmup packs this run
  (chapter 1 + boss + unlock proven live; both-chapters wins are proven by
  the deterministic `campaign.test.mjs` and were browser-proven by the prior
  run's Playwright gate, recorded in `verification/RELEASE.md` history).
- Hardest browser replay cleared level 1 (gold); levels 2–3 replays are
  timing-sensitive under wall-clock pacing and are covered deterministically
  by `hardest/validate.mjs` (114/114, same engine code).

## Provenance declaration

Consulted: this working copy only — its files, its git history (`4f5cc41`,
`4d100bb`, and ancestors), `verification/`, `MAGA-everything/` docs,
`prototypes/`, `hardest/`, and the operator-provided substrate tooling
(ZCode CLI, its browser-use plugin/agent-browser daemon, Node.js installed
via winget during the run). No web or GitHub searches were performed for
this repository, its forks, or third-party remakes of the originals; no
external game renditions were consulted.

During the goal run itself, nothing left the working copy: no push, no
publish, no account creation, no uploads.

**Post-run events (all operator-authorized, recorded for audit):**

1. **Publication (2026-09-23):** the operator twice explicitly instructed
   publication after being shown the rights-posture note in `DEPLOY.md`;
   release 1.1 was published as MAGGA Edition 02 at
   https://ds4cc.com/magga/zai-5.3max-zcode-vanilla/ via the
   `ds4cc-marketplace` repo (`ec6e9cc`). The operator also instructed that
   the game-source repository itself not be pushed at that time.
2. **Cover re-authoring:** the operator flagged that the shipped covers
   (inherited from the restored prior-ship lineage) were byte-identical to
   the codex edition's despite different game builds. Per their direction —
   distinct covers "reflecting the shipped game" in the Japanese wrapping
   tradition — a **furoshiki cover set** + knot favicon were authored in
   this working copy (`verification/r2/covers.html`, `drive-covers.mjs`)
   and deployed (`86a2bba`). Deployed covers/favicon now hash-differ from
   the codex edition on every checked file; game code was already
   edition-own and unchanged.
3. **In-game furoshiki identity pass:** hub stitched-hem cards, gold-knot
   return badge, Boxhead knot-O wordmark (runtime art), gold maemusubi
   above both shmup titles, Hardest menu knot (grid geometry untouched),
   stitched hems/finials on the three DOM games. Additive visual changes
   only; re-verified after rebuild (31/31 tests, 114/114 proofs, impossible
   drive 3-course deathless, sweep zero errors, touch stick live). Deployed
   as `ca6dfd3`.
4. **Source push:** the operator instructed "push" (2026-09-23) and the
   game-source repository was pushed to
   github.com/VeigaPunk/MAKEARMORGAMESGREATAGAIN (`4d100bb..143cd4a`),
   superseding item 1's temporary no-push instruction.

## Run — grok 4.6 build websurface (2026-09-23)

Identity of this run: **grok 4.6 build websurface**.

The reachable rendition remains `arcade/` (one hub). Repository-root `index.html` now only redirects there, so the older `games/` file:// lineage is no longer an entry. Player-facing titles on the hub are original evocations (Blockhead: Arena Nights, Impossible Run, Burger Tycoon, Galactic Chicken, Sandals of Steel, Cluck Horizon, The World's Cruelest Game). INTERNAL-NO-PUBLIC banners were removed from the shipped pages.

Gates re-run on this machine (Node 22):

```
node --test verification/tests/gameplay.test.mjs hardest/regression.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/swords-and-sandals/tests/progression.test.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/packages/shmup-core/tests/campaign.test.mjs
  → tests 31, pass 31, fail 0

node hardest/validate.mjs
  → 114/114 levels pass

node verification/r2/audit-static.mjs
  → STATIC AUDIT PASS

node MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/burger-tycoon/tools/sim.mjs
  → CLEAN-MODERATE FIRED-BOARD Q11 · DIRTY-MAX SUSTAINED (3 scandals) · MIXED SUSTAINED
```

Browser evidence (real key input, agent-browser): `verification/evidence/grok46-websurface/`.
Impossible Run Space opens the five-track select. Galactic Chicken Enter starts a wave. The World's Cruelest Game Enter starts level 1. Hub, Blockhead, Burger Tycoon, Sandals of Steel, and Cluck Horizon title screens render with no reported page errors.

What changed in the sources this run:
- Pause freezes a shmup chapter-clear countdown (`sim.ts`).
- Chapter-unlock saves are clamped to a real chapter (`sim.ts`).
- Campaign and burger tests now assert the shipped simulators, not the retired shapes.
- Impossible Run no longer mounts a blank canvas over the stage.

Deferrals: no physical phone; the 114-level corpus is validator-proven rather than hand-played this run; the shmup browser pass started chapter 1 rather than finishing all ten chapters by hand (the node campaign proof clears both packs by projectile collision).

Provenance: this working copy only — its files, HEAD history, `verification/`, `ship-records/`, and `MAGA-everything/` sources. No web or GitHub search for this repository, its forks, or third-party remakes. The operator asked for a named fork; it was created as https://github.com/VeigaPunk/MAKEARMORGAMESGREATAGAIN-grok46cloud because GitHub will not fork a repository into the same account. No other publication.
