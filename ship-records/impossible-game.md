# The Impossible Game — ship record

Original: The Impossible Game (Fluke Games; feel reference = 2010 Lite Flash
release; content target = the full game). Shipped title (original evocation):
**IMPOSSIBLE RUN**.

## Survey (2026-09-22)

| Rendition | Location | State |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| TS app (Canvas 2D) | `apps/impossible/src/main.ts` | 1 level, verified collision parity (gap-kill x=1410, block front-edge x=2967) |
| Prototype | `prototypes/impossible-game.html` | Mechanics proof + practice + calibration + full-clear proof |

## Decision: EXTEND the TS app; PORT proto features (binding)

App is canonical (chrome, scaling, verified collision). Proto's practice
checkpoints ported in; campaign authored fresh on the collision-verified core.

## Phase 1 lane report (2026-09-23)

**Campaign — 5 original-evocation tracks (full game, not the Lite slice):**
EMBER WAKE (fire opener, 135 BPM) · PRIME MOVER (plain square, 120) · CHAOS
DREAM (dense spike rhythms, 140) · SKYWARD (airy gaps, 110) · PHASE DRIFT
(finale, 150). 101/84/171/61/195 obstacles; each 2.5–3.25 min at 360px/s.
All levels + 30 practice checkpoints proven clearable by the bundled solver
(`tools/prove.mjs`, BFS + jump-window simulation with the game's exact
physics constants): **ALL LEVELS PASS**, every checkpoint spawn-safe.

**AudioSyncClock:** obstacles are authored on each level's own 16th-note grid
(pxStep = 5400/bpm) — one grid step of travel = one 16th note; songs and
obstacles share the grid so jump windows land on beats. Per-level 2-3 track
chip songs (bass pump + lead + drums) via arcade-core `playSong`; menu bed;
music stops on pause and resumes at cube position; death duck 300ms.

**Modes:** NORMAL (die → restart ≤200ms; measured respawn loop: runT 0.19s
after death, 9 deaths in 7s at the first spike = instant-restart feel) and
PRACTICE (checkpoint flags: 6 built-in grid-snapped flags per level + C/plant
your own (toggle, ground-only, block-top planting prevented); practice
respawn at flag verified live — cube re-appears at flag, not at 0%).

**Defects:**
- **D-35** fixed: pointerdown/keydown are event-queued (`pendingJump`/
  `pendingPtr` consumed next frame) — no per-frame edge polling.
- **D-60**: `__maga` is the only window hook.
- **D-61**: all persisted progress clamped [0,1] at load AND save.
- **Letterbox pointer offset (found in my verification, boxhead D-09 class)**:
  `toLogical` divided by scale without subtracting canvas origin — every
  pointer tap landed offset by the letterbox position. Fixed with
  rect-relative conversion; pointer-driven menus now work (tap-to-start
  verified end-to-end: select → mode → practice, plus pause-overlay
  EXIT/RESTART buttons).

**Chrome:** title, track select (palette chips, medal, BPM, length, best%,
lock states), mode screen, pause overlay (RESUME/RESTART/EXIT, pointer +
Esc/Space), clear screen (medal, NEXT/RETRY/TRACKS), volume row ([ ]/M +
clickable −/+), progress bar + attempt counter in-run, R quick-restart.
Touch: whole-canvas tap = jump; practice DROP FLAG touch button.

**Medals + persistence:** CLEARED (finish) / PERFECT (≤5 deaths) — unlock
next track; bests + medals persisted via arcade-core storage (verified across
reload).

## Acceptance checklist

- [x] 5 levels solver-proven clearable + 30 checkpoints spawn-safe.
- [x] Boot from file://, zero console errors (re-verified post-fix).
- [x] Real keyboard: title→select→mode→run; timed Space tap cleared the first
  lethal gap (best advanced 2.61%→2.77%); death→instant restart verified.
- [x] Practice: flag drop via C (planted at x=2070), die, respawn at flag.
- [x] Pause: Esc toggles (music stops/resumes); overlay EXIT exits (pointer).
- [x] Pointer menus work post-letterbox-fix (full flow driven by taps).
- [x] Persistence across reload (bests, medals, unlock).
- [x] Collision parity constants untouched (death at the known gap x≈1410
  observed in every no-jump run).

## Verification commands + last observed results

```bash
node MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/impossible/tools/prove.mjs
# 2026-09-23: ALL LEVELS PASS — 5 tracks, 30/30 checkpoints spawn-safe+solvable

node tools/ship-build.mjs --only impossible
# 2026-09-23: impossible: 69 KB html

# Browser file:// games/impossible/index.html?debug — zero console errors;
# real-input drive (keyboard + pointer) as above; evidence
# verification/evidence/p11-impossible-select.png
```

## Known deferrals

- No level editor (original PC full-game feature; out of v1 scope).
- Input-offset calibration slider (proto feature) not carried over — desktop
  timing is the canonical path per spec; coyote 0.10s / jump-buffer 0.06s
  kept as modern-craft additions.
- Audio ducking is a fixed 300ms envelope, not a separate gain chain.

## Provenance

Reference set: this checkpoint (apps/impossible, prototype card + html,
divergence register D-33/34/35/60/61, MECHANICS-DIGEST §6 AudioSyncClock gap)
and my own knowledge of the original. No web/GitHub searches for this
repository, forks, or third-party remakes. Run: zai/glm-5.3 on omp; lane work
by glm-5.3 subagents (routing corrected per operator directive before edits
landed); integration fixes and verification by the session model.

_Preserved for continuity; the current run's verification above is the living head._

# The Impossible Game — ship record (release 1.1, run of 2026-09-22)

Original: The Impossible Game (feel reference: 2010 Lite release; content
target: the full game). One-button rhythm autorunner, fixed-impulse jump,
instant respawn.

## Survey

- `MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/impossible` — TS app; at
  `4f5cc41`: three authored courses with distinct palettes, unlock
  progression, practice mode with checkpoints and separate records,
  synthesized music bed, title/pause/clear/retry flows.
- `prototypes/impossible-game.html` — mechanics proof (fixed-impulse jump
  physics, sub-frame tap rules). Historical reference only; not reachable
  from the entry point.

## Decision

**Adopt** the `4f5cc41` app (restored). The prototype remains a historical
mechanics reference; exactly one rendition is reachable from the hub.

## Acceptance checklist — last observed results

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Course 1 full clear, real Space taps at recorded jump x-positions | PASS live: cleared in 27.2 s, 17/17 jumps, 0 deaths |
| Course 2 full clear | PASS live: 34.7 s, 19 jumps, 0 deaths |
| Course 3 full clear | PASS live: 40.5 s, 24 jumps, 0 deaths |
| Unlock progression (course N+1 after clearing N) | PASS live: course buttons 2 and 3 became selectable and were selected via real clicks |
| Death → instant respawn | PASS live: died at x=1410 refusing to jump; attempt 2 running ~1.2 s later |
| Pause / resume / quit to title | PASS live: DOM pause button, overlay buttons clicked |
| Mute | PASS live: DOM sound button clicked |
| Sim-level guarantees (landing never snaps through platforms, practice checkpoints, records) | PASS: `verification/tests/gameplay.test.mjs` (node suite, 31/31) |
| Console health / self-containment | PASS (sweep + audit) |

## Verification commands

```
node --test verification/tests/gameplay.test.mjs    # includes all three course tapes at 60 Hz
node verification/r2/drive-impossible.mjs           # live input gate
```
Evidence: `verification/evidence/release-r2/10..13-*.png`, `impossible-drive.log.json`.

## Known deferrals

- Practice mode exercised at sim level only this run (its live UI was not
  driven); normal-mode full completion covers the shipped content bar.

## Provenance

Consulted only this working copy (files, git history, prior records) and the
original game as remembered. No external renditions consulted; no web or
GitHub searches about this project; nothing left the working copy.

## Run — grok 4.6 build websurface (2026-09-23)

Identity of this run: **grok 4.6 build websurface**.

The reachable rendition remains `arcade/` (one hub). Repository-root `index.html` now only redirects there, so the older `games/` file:// lineage is no longer an entry. Player-facing titles on the hub are original evocations (Blockhead: Arena Nights, Impossible Run, Burger Tycoon, Galactic Chicken, Sandals of Steel, Cluck Horizon, The World's Cruelest Game). INTERNAL-NO-PUBLIC banners were removed from the shipped pages.

Gates re-run on this machine (Node 22):

```
node --test verification/tests/gameplay.test.mjs hardest/regression.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/swords-and-sandals/tests/progression.test.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/packages/shmup-core/tests/campaign.test.mjs
  → tests 31, pass 31, fail 0

node hardest/validate.mjs
  → 114/114 levels pass

node verification/r2/audit-static.mjs
  → STATIC AUDIT PASS

node MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/burger-tycoon/tools/sim.mjs
  → CLEAN-MODERATE FIRED-BOARD Q11 · DIRTY-MAX SUSTAINED (3 scandals) · MIXED SUSTAINED
```

Browser evidence (real key input, agent-browser): `verification/evidence/grok46-websurface/`.
Impossible Run Space opens the five-track select. Galactic Chicken Enter starts a wave. The World's Cruelest Game Enter starts level 1. Hub, Blockhead, Burger Tycoon, Sandals of Steel, and Cluck Horizon title screens render with no reported page errors.

What changed in the sources this run:
- Pause freezes a shmup chapter-clear countdown (`sim.ts`).
- Chapter-unlock saves are clamped to a real chapter (`sim.ts`).
- Campaign and burger tests now assert the shipped simulators, not the retired shapes.
- Impossible Run no longer mounts a blank canvas over the stage.

Deferrals: no physical phone; the 114-level corpus is validator-proven rather than hand-played this run; the shmup browser pass started chapter 1 rather than finishing all ten chapters by hand (the node campaign proof clears both packs by projectile collision).

Provenance: this working copy only — its files, HEAD history, `verification/`, `ship-records/`, and `MAGA-everything/` sources. No web or GitHub search for this repository, its forks, or third-party remakes. The operator asked for a named fork; it was created as https://github.com/VeigaPunk/MAKEARMORGAMESGREATAGAIN-grok46cloud because GitHub will not fork a repository into the same account. No other publication.
