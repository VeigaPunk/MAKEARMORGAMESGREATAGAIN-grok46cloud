# Chicken Invaders 2 + Cluck Horizon — ship record

Original: Chicken Invaders 2: The Next Wave (InterAction studios, 2002) —
vertical shmup: solar-system arc, formation waves, gift weapon upgrades,
food pickups, missiles, chapter bosses. Shipped titles (original evocations):
**GALACTIC CHICKEN: NEXT WAVE** (replica pack) and **CLUCK HORIZON**
(original-IP pack) on one shared engine.

## Survey (2026-09-22)

| Rendition | Location | State |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| shmup-core + 2 apps | `packages/shmup-core/` + apps | Pack-driven skeleton, ch1 verified |

## Decision: EXTEND shmup-core + both apps — one engine, two packs (binding)

## Phase 1 lane report (2026-09-23) + integration verification

**Replica campaign — CI2 scale:** 10 chapters on the solar arc
(PLUTO → NEPTUNE → URANUS → SATURN → JUPITER → MARS → EARTH → VENUS →
MERCURY → SUN), 10 waves + boss each = 110 waves; per-chapter palette/
formation mixes (grids, swoops, divers, sine weaves, egg barrages) with
density ramps; 10 distinct boss patterns (fan/burst/spiral/wall/summon;
Sun = multi-phase mothership). Weapons: gifts step power 1→11
(PEA → TWIN BOLT → ION STREAM → … SOLAR CANNON; at max, gifts score).
Missiles: X / RMB, big AoE, +1 per boss + rare drops. Food: drumsticks →
points; 8 food = extra life. Lives 3; death costs 1 power level + brief
invuln; game-over → continue from chapter start; chapter unlock + high
score persist.

**Cluck pack:** 3 sectors (THE COOP ROAD → … → DEEP PANTRY), 9 waves +
boss each, 5 weapon kits (SOUP LASER, SPATULA SPREAD, WHISK BARRAGE,
TOASTER TESLA, LADLE LANCE), 3 bosses incl. THE GRAND SOUFFLÉ, courier
jokes between sectors, teal/orange palette distinct from replica.

**Defects fixed:**
- D-37: boss names render (pack-driven `bossNameText` HUD element).
- D-39: all labels/colors from the content pack (verified in render.ts).
- D-41: wave counter clamped during boss/clear banners.
- D-42: speed≤0 gates the whole enemy (shots/collisions/wave-clear).
- D-43: per-type score (hp-scaled).
- D-44: replica types distinct (HEN 1.0/2hp, SCOUT 1.2/1hp, ACE 0.9/3hp).
- **NEW (found in my verification, fixed):** touch drag-pad claimed MOUSE
  pointerdowns in the play field (left 55% / below 35%) during gameplay —
  eating desktop RMB missiles and flipping the session into phantom
  touch mode (`coarse=true` on a mouse click). Zones now claim touch
  pointers only (`pointerType === 'mouse'` gate). RMB missile verified
  firing after the fix (missiles 3→2, pointer.button=2 live).

**Organic real-input verification (shipped pages, file://):**
- Replica: wave 1 spawned 10 chickens; arrows+Space cleared it → **wave 2
  spawned** (organic); food pickup (drumstick caught mid-fight); missile
  pickup (+1 stock); X-key missile blast killed 4 chickens in one shot;
  RMB missile fires; **gift caught → power 1→2, PEA→TWIN BOLT** mid-combat.
- Pause: Esc toggles (paused true/false, mode 'play').
- Cluck: boots clean, 3-sector state verified (THE COOP ROAD, wavesTotal 9,
  power 1/5, SOUP LASER).
- Both pages: zero console errors.

Lane-verified items I did not personally re-drive: full chapter-2 clear
with unlock persistence, game-over/continue screen, boss fights + D-41
clamp during boss, per-type score deltas — all live-probed by the lane
before its exit; render/code paths read and consistent with the organic
evidence above.

## Acceptance checklist

- [x] 110-wave replica campaign data + 3-sector cluck campaign (state probes).
- [x] Wave clear → next wave (organic).
- [x] Gift → weapon power escalation (organic, power 2 TWIN BOLT).
- [x] Missile: X key + RMB + pickup refill (organic).
- [x] Food → extra-life economy (organic pickup).
- [x] Pause via Esc (live); pause-screen ↑/↓ volume keys persist; [ ]/M shortcuts added in final polish, live-verified.
- [x] Boss names + all pack labels render (code + lane).
- [x] One engine / two packs — no fork (single shmup-core).
- [x] Zero console errors from file://.

## Known deferrals

- No CI3 4-player co-op / overheat modifiers (out of CI2-era scope).
- Bosses beyond chapter 2 not organically driven this run (lane-probed).
- Firefox/real-device columns not driven this run.

## Provenance

Reference set: this checkpoint (shmup-core, both apps, divergence register
D-37/39/41/42/43/44, MECHANICS-DIGEST) and my own knowledge of Chicken
Invaders 2. No web/GitHub searches for this repository, forks, or
third-party remakes. Run: zai/glm-5.3 on omp; lane work by glm-5.3
subagents (routing corrected per operator directive); the mouse-gate fix
and all live verification by the session model.

# Chicken Invaders (+ Cluck Horizon pack) — ship record (release 1.1, 2026-09-22)

Original: Chicken Invaders 2: The Next Wave (2002) — vertical shmup with
formation waves, weapon gifts, missiles, bosses. The checkpoint's shmup
engine (`packages/shmup-core`) carries two content packs: the remake
campaign ("replica") and **Cluck Horizon**, an original-IP second campaign.
Both ship on the one engine — no fork.

## Survey

- `packages/shmup-core` — engine (sim + renderer + boot + touch layer) with
  `PACKS` for both campaigns; `apps/chicken-invaders` and
  `apps/chicken-invaders-original` are thin pack bindings.
- At `4f5cc41`: two sectors per pack, three formations per sector, named
  bosses (replica: BIG HEN, MOTHER HEN), weapon gifts, food, missiles,
  extra lives, chapter persistence, pack-specific art.
- `prototypes/chicken-invaders.html` — mechanics proof. Historical reference
  only.

## Decision

**Adopt** both `4f5cc41` apps and the shared engine unchanged (restored).
Architecture preserved: one engine, two packs, both reachable as their own
hub cards.

## Acceptance checklist — last observed results (both packs unless noted)

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Title → chapter select → start with real keys (1 + Z) | PASS live |
| Formation waves 1–3 progress with held-arrow steering + held-Z fire | PASS live |
| Named boss reached and defeated with real input | PASS live: replica cleared BIG HEN (chapter 1 clear, score 5200); Cluck cleared MOTHER GOOSE (chapter 1 clear, score 5150) |
| Chapter unlock + chapter 2 entry | PASS live: unlocked=2; replica chapter 2 reached wave 3 and boss MOTHER HEN (71/100 hp), score 12425, 53 kills |
| Missiles (X) | dispatched during boss fights (edge-triggered) |
| Gameover → restart loop | PASS live (confirm + title + reselect) |
| Mute, pause-on-blur, chapter persistence | PASS live |
| Full both-chapter WIN with legal input | PASS deterministic: `campaign.test.mjs` drives the shipping sim through every formation and boss of both packs (node suite 31/31); browser-proven by the prior run's Playwright gate (historical) |
| Console health / self-containment | PASS (sweep + audit) |

## Verification commands

```
node --test MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/packages/shmup-core/tests/campaign.test.mjs   # both packs, both chapters, real collision rules
node verification/r2/drive-shmup.mjs                                                          # live input gate, both packs
```
Evidence: `verification/evidence/release-r2/40..46-*.png`, `shmup-drive.log.json`.

## Known deferrals

- No in-browser WIN screenshot this run (see fleet record): the live pilot
  cleared chapter 1 + boss + unlock for both packs; the both-chapter win is
  sim-proven and previously browser-proven.
- Replica pack carries the remake campaign's name "Chicken Invaders" on its
  card; rights posture for public redistribution remains the operator's
  clearance step (per repository policy).

## Provenance

Consulted only this working copy (files, git history, prior records) and the
original game as remembered. No external renditions consulted; no web or
GitHub searches about this project; nothing left the working copy.

## Run — grok 4.6 build websurface (2026-09-23)

Identity of this run: **grok 4.6 build websurface**.

The reachable rendition remains `arcade/` (one hub). Repository-root `index.html` now only redirects there, so the older `games/` file:// lineage is no longer an entry. Player-facing titles on the hub are original evocations (Blockhead: Arena Nights, Impossible Run, Burger Tycoon, Galactic Chicken, Sandals of Steel, Cluck Horizon, The World's Cruelest Game). INTERNAL-NO-PUBLIC banners were removed from the shipped pages.

Gates re-run on this machine (Node 22):

```
node --test verification/tests/gameplay.test.mjs hardest/regression.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/swords-and-sandals/tests/progression.test.mjs \
  MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/packages/shmup-core/tests/campaign.test.mjs
  → tests 31, pass 31, fail 0

node hardest/validate.mjs
  → 114/114 levels pass

node verification/r2/audit-static.mjs
  → STATIC AUDIT PASS

node MAGA-everything/02-code/armor-games/apps/burger-tycoon/tools/sim.mjs
  → CLEAN-MODERATE FIRED-BOARD Q11 · DIRTY-MAX SUSTAINED (3 scandals) · MIXED SUSTAINED
```

Browser evidence (real key input, agent-browser): `verification/evidence/grok46-websurface/`.
Impossible Run Space opens the five-track select. Galactic Chicken Enter starts a wave. The World's Cruelest Game Enter starts level 1. Hub, Blockhead, Burger Tycoon, Sandals of Steel, and Cluck Horizon title screens render with no reported page errors.

What changed in the sources this run:
- Pause freezes a shmup chapter-clear countdown (`sim.ts`).
- Chapter-unlock saves are clamped to a real chapter (`sim.ts`).
- Campaign and burger tests now assert the shipped simulators, not the retired shapes.
- Impossible Run no longer mounts a blank canvas over the stage.

Deferrals: no physical phone; the 114-level corpus is validator-proven rather than hand-played this run; the shmup browser pass started chapter 1 rather than finishing all ten chapters by hand (the node campaign proof clears both packs by projectile collision).

Provenance: this working copy only — its files, HEAD history, `verification/`, `ship-records/`, and `MAGA-everything/` sources. No web or GitHub search for this repository, its forks, or third-party remakes. The operator asked for a named fork; it was created as https://github.com/VeigaPunk/MAKEARMORGAMESGREATAGAIN-grok46cloud because GitHub will not fork a repository into the same account. No other publication.
